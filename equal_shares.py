def equal_shares(voters, projects, cost, approvers, total_budget):
    """
    Computes the Method of Equal Shares for Participatory Budgeting.
    https://equalshares.net/implementation/computation

    Args:
        voters (list): A list of voter names.
        projects (list): A list of project IDs.
        cost (dict): A dictionary mapping project IDs to their respective costs.
        approvers (dict): A dictionary mapping project IDs to the list of voters who approve them.
        total_budget (int): The total budget available.

    Returns:
        list: A list of project IDs that are selected by the Method of Equal Shares.

    Example:
        >>> equal_shares(
        >>>    voters=["v1", "v2", "v3"], 
        >>>    projects=["p1", "p2", "p3"],

        >>>    approvers={"p1": ["v1", "v2"], "p2": ["v1"], "p3": ["v3"]},
